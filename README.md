## Data Loading

1. **Load the Dataset**:
    - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

## Basic Exploration

2. **First Look at the Data**:
    - Display the first 10 rows of the dataset.
    - Display the summary statistics of the dataset.

3. **Unique Values**:
    - Find the total number of unique stores.
    - Find the total number of unique products.

4. **Total Revenue Calculation**:
    - Calculate the total revenue generated by all stores.

## NumPy Operations

5. **NumPy Array Conversion**:
    - Convert the `Quantity` column into a NumPy array.

6. **Statistical Analysis**:
    - Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the quantities sold using NumPy.

7. **Advanced NumPy Operations**:
    - Create a new NumPy array that contains the square root of the `Revenue` values.

## Data Manipulation with pandas

8. **Revenue per Unit**:
    - Create a new column `Revenue_per_Unit`, which is the revenue divided by the quantity.

9. **Top Products**:
    - Find the top 5 products by total revenue.

10. **Group by Store**:
    - Group the data by `Store` and calculate the total revenue for each store.

11. **Group by Store and Product**:
    - Group the data by `Store` and `Product` and find the total quantity sold for each combination.

12. **Filter Data**:
    - Filter the data to show only sales where the revenue per unit is greater than the average revenue per unit.

13. **Cumulative Revenue**:
    - Add a new column `Cumulative_Revenue` that shows the cumulative revenue for each store over time.

## Advanced Analysis

14. **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Find the correlation between `Quantity` and `Revenue`.

15. **Revenue Contribution**:
    - Calculate the percentage contribution of each product to the total revenue.

16. **Store Performance**:
    - Identify the store with the highest average revenue per sale.
